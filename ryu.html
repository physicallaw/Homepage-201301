 <ol type="I">
  <li><i> Amateur career</i><br>
Ryu attended Dongsan High School in Incheon, South Korea. In 2004, he underwent Tommy John surgery so he did not pitch in any official games. In 2005, he led his team to the Blue Dragon Open National High School Championship, pitching 22 scoreless innings as the team's ace and batting .389 as a slugger in the tournament, and was named Best Pitcher. In 2005, he was selected for the South Korea national junior team that was runner-up at the 6th Asian Junior Baseball Championship in Seoul, South Korea. Ryu started the semifinal match against Chinese Taipei, and helped his team reach the final, throwing ten strikeouts and giving up one unearned run on four hits in six innings. During the competition, he pitched eight1⁄3 innings with 14 strikeouts, and gave up an unearned run on five hits in three games (one start).<br>
  <li><i> Professional career</i>
<ol type="i">     <li><u> Hanwha Eagles (2006-2012)</u><br>
In July 2005, Ryu was selected by the Hanwha Eagles with the 1st pick in the second round of the 2006 KBO Draft, and made his professional debut on April 12, 2006. In his rookie year of 2006, Ryu burst onto the scene, going 18–6 with a 2.23 ERA and 205 strikeouts in 201.2 innings pitched. He earned the pitching Triple Crown, and was eventually named both Rookie of the year and Player of the Year. He became the only player in KPB history to win both the Rookie of the Year award and the MVP award in the same season.<br>

In August 2008, Ryu competed for the South Korea national baseball team in the 2008 Beijing Olympics, where they won the gold medal in the baseball tournament. In the Olympics, Ryu pitched a 1–0 complete game shutout victory over Canada, giving up five hits in the team's third game of round-robin play. In the gold medal game against Cuba, he pitched 81⁄3 innings, allowing two earned runs in a 3–2 victory.<br>

In March 2009, he represented the South Korea national baseball team in the 2009 World Baseball Classic, where the team was the runner-up to the eventual champion, Japan.<br>

In 2010, Ryu played in the 2010 Asian Games, where the South Korea national baseball team won the gold medal in baseball. On May 11, 2010, Ryu became the first pitcher in history to strike out 17 batters in a nine-inning game, against the LG Twins at Cheongju Sports Complex - Baseball Stadium.<br>

Ryu repeatedly expressed his desire to play in the United States for Major League Baseball. On October 29, 2012, the Eagles announced that Ryu would be posted as early as November 1, 2012 to allow MLB teams to bid for the rights to negotiate with him.<br>
   <li><u> Los Angeles Dodgers</u><br>
On November 9, 2012, the Eagles accepted the reported bid of $25,737,737.33 from the Los Angeles Dodgers, giving them a 30 day period to try to negotiate a contract with Ryu. On December 9, he was signed to a 6 year, $36 million deal, that included the option to opt out after the 5th year if certain performance benchmarks were reached (750 innings pitched by year 5, an average of 150 innings/year).<br>

He made his Major League Baseball debut when he was the starting pitcher for the Dodgers against the San Francisco Giants on April 2, 2013. He allowed 10 hits in 6.1 innings but only one earned run. Ryu picked up his first Major League win on April 7 over the Pittsburgh Pirates. On April 13th against the Arizona Diamondbacks, he would record his first major league hit with a double in the third inning. He wound up 3 for 3 at the plate in the game, the first Dodgers pitcher to get three hits in a game since Randy Wolf in 2009. This game was also his 100th career win, in Korea and the U.S. combined.<br>

 <li><b><h3> Pitching style</h3></b><br>
Ryu is a 6 ft 2 in, 255 lb left-handed pitcher. He throws a fastball around 90 mph (tops out at 95 mph), a decent curveball, a slider, and a deceptive changeup. Scouts say that the changeup is his best pitch and is a legitimate out-pitch at the big league level.
